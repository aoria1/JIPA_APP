Java Interview Perpartion Application

What is it?
-----------
The JAVA Interview Preparation Application (JIPA) is an android based mobile application,
which is intended to help users prepare for upcoming job interviews. JIPA will focus on relevant
interview content related to the JAVA programming language and software development. The
application will be free to download from either a mobile phone application store or similar
services. Application users will have the option to view interview questions, complete an
interview quiz, and submit new questions for review. Users will also have the option to provide
feedback per individual question (i.e. like or dislike) and feedback related to the entire
application. An administrator will manage the application through a website where relevant
metrics will be monitored and information (i.e. feedback) will be processed to improve
application utility. The application will not function without an Internet connection and will only
work with Android mobile devices.
